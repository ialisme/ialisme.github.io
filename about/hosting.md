The instance itself is hosted on servers at [Online.net](https://online.net) and
[Scaleway.com](http://scaleway.com), in Paris, France. The database and files are frequently
replicated on a couple of servers, and externally backuped.

The servers are run by an organization (with no legal grounds; entierly privately owned) called
[random.sh](https://random.sh) / [random labs](https://randomlabs.co); which hosts other services
such as irc.random.sh, a ChatSpike.net IRC Server, [Etherpad.fr](http://etherpad.fr), and much more.
I also intend to one day make it my own company for some products, but I'll then separate the business
with theses community services (the business will just be a sponsor, and without any advertisement, tracking,
or anything else evil).
