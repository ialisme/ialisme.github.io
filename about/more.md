<i>[ Mastodon will insert here a one-liner presentation of the instance, with our logo and statistics ]</i>

Our guidelines are currently being written ; but basically:

*   don't be a dick,
*   no advertising, harassment, spam,
*   no abuse on the API by local users (bots, ...),
*   Any thing illegal under the French law will be removed and reported to the competent authorities.

Informations and status about the instance is posted to [@admin](/@admin), while we also have a longer-format
[blog](/blog/) for huge announcements, â€¦.

You can learn more about how [the collective is formed](/about/collective/), [hosting informations](/about/hosting/),
and [history](/about/history/)

Don't hesitate to ping either @admin to talk about the instance, create an issue at
[hrefhref/mastodon](https://github.com/hrefhref/mastodon/issues) on GitHub, or privately at `admin (at) soc.ialis.me`.
