<em>IMPORTANT NOTICE</em>

You've reached the static Jekyll site that will run on top of [soc.ialis.me](https://soc.ialis.me)'s Mastodon instance.

The `/about` (`about.md`) is partially managed by Jekyll, but hosted by Mastodon. Please put your content below, and an
admin once the page ready for publication will copy the code inside Mastodon's administration interface.

(This is where there's the Mastodon presentation, features, and sign-up form -- <em>ultimately the sidebar is not
shown</em>).
